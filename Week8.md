Week 08 – Cloud Computing (Summary)

This week focused on understanding cloud infrastructure using Microsoft Azure through guided lab activities in Microsoft Learn On Demand. The main goal was to learn how cloud platforms deploy, secure, and manage computing resources efficiently compared to on-premise systems.

Task 1 – Knowledge Test

At the start of class, students completed a short test to review their understanding of cloud computing concepts before beginning the practical lab work.

Task 2 – Login to Microsoft Learn On Demand

Students registered and logged into the Microsoft Learn On Demand (Skillable) platform using a training key from Moodle. Temporary Azure accounts were provided to perform lab exercises without using personal or CQU accounts.
This task introduced the Microsoft Learn environment and the Azure Fundamentals modules.

Task 3 – Create an Azure Resource

Students completed Module 01, which involved creating an Azure resource (like a virtual machine, storage account, or database).
They listed each created resource and briefly explained its purpose — for example, a virtual network to connect resources securely or a storage account for file management.
This activity built understanding of Azure’s basic resource management.

Task 4 – Create an Azure Virtual Machine and Allow Web Access

In Module 02, students learned how to:

Create and configure an Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) in Azure.

Add Network Security Group (NSG) rules to allow HTTP (port 80) access in addition to SSH (port 22).

Edit the VM’s web page using SSH and nano, inserting their name into the HTML file.

Verify successful access through a web browser.

They also documented Azure CLI commands, public IP addresses, and explained the purpose of each network rule.
This exercise demonstrated how firewalls, ports, and web servers operate within a cloud environment.

Task 5 – Compare Cloud vs On-Premise Costs

Students compared the cost and specifications of a physical desktop PC with a cloud-based virtual machine using the Azure Pricing Calculator and Australian PC retailers.
They calculated costs over 1-year and 3-year periods, discussing trade-offs such as:

Cloud flexibility vs upfront hardware costs

Maintenance and scalability benefits

Long-term cost efficiency for organizations

This task emphasized financial and operational differences between traditional and cloud computing systems.

Task 6 (Optional) – Create a Storage Blob in Azure

Students explored Azure Blob Storage by uploading images with different access permissions (private and public).
They learned how to manage container access and resolve “anonymous access blocked” errors by enabling public blob access in the configuration settings.
This demonstrated data storage and access control in cloud services.

Task 7 (Optional) – Create a Resource Lock

Students created read-only and delete locks to prevent accidental modification or deletion of critical resources.
They explained how each lock type works and its role in maintaining resource integrity.

Overall Learning Summary

By the end of Week 8, students learned to:

Navigate and use Azure through Microsoft Learn On Demand

Deploy and manage cloud resources

Configure web servers and security rules

Compare costs between cloud and on-premise infrastructure

Understand storage, access control, and resource protection in Azure

This week developed both technical and analytical cloud computing skills, preparing students for modern IT and cybersecurity environments.
