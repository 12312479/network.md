Week 09 – Attacks and Vulnerabilities (Summary)

This week focused on understanding how systems can be attacked, what motivates attackers, and how to identify and manage vulnerabilities using real-world examples from the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The activities built on security fundamentals and encouraged practical analysis and ethical thinking about cyber risk and disclosure.

Task 1 – Knowledge Test (10 min)

At the beginning of class, students completed a short knowledge test to check their understanding of attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities before starting the practical activities.

Task 2 – CIA Protections (20 min)

Students identified the most important assets in their project’s network, such as servers, databases, or security devices.
Using the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), they analyzed which protection type is most important for each asset and explained why.

Example:

Asset: Customer database

Protection: Confidentiality

Reason: Only authorized users should access customer data.

This task helped students think critically about what needs protection and why, which is essential for designing secure networks.

Task 3 – Threat Sources and Motivation 

Students listed possible threat sources (attackers) and described their motivations.
Examples included:

Neighbor: Trying to access free Wi-Fi.

Competitor company: Attempting to steal sensitive data.

This task helped students understand who might attack a system and their goals, which supports better defense planning in cybersecurity projects.

Task 4 – Explore Vulnerabilities 

Using the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD), students researched three different Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) from the past 12 months:

One Critical severity

One High severity

One Medium severity

For each CVE, they identified:

CVE ID and Description

Date and CVSS v3 Score

CIA Impact (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) ID and Name

Affected company and product details

Explanation of the vulnerability in simple terms

Methods for detection and mitigation

This activity provided hands-on experience in analyzing real-world vulnerabilities and understanding their impact and risk levels.

Task 5 – Vulnerability Disclosures 

Students explored how vulnerabilities are reported and disclosed. They learned that when a security researcher finds a flaw, it is first reported privately to the vendor before being made public as a CVE.

They discussed questions like:

Why do vendors sometimes delay public disclosure?

What is a “reasonable” delay?

Should researchers ever make vulnerabilities public without vendor permission?

Students also read about responsible disclosure policies and bug bounty programs from trusted sources such as:

OWASP

Microsoft

SEI CERT

Broadcom

MITRE

In their journals, students wrote their own viewpoint on how vulnerability disclosure should be handled, balancing security, ethics, and public safety.

Overall Learning Summary

By the end of Week 9, students learned to:

Identify and prioritize network assets using the CIA Triad

Recognize different threat actors and their motivations

Analyze real-world vulnerabilities (CVEs) and their impacts

Understand responsible vulnerability disclosure and ethical considerations

This week improved understanding of how cyber threats emerge, how vulnerabilities are assessed, and why ethical handling of disclosures is vital in cybersecurity.
