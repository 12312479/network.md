 Week 4 – Networking and Cyber Security

Topic: Network Technologies
Goal: Understand basic network design, ARP/ICMP analysis, and project setup tasks.

Task 1 – Knowledge Test 

Complete the weekly knowledge test at the start of class.

This helps check my understanding before beginning practical work.

Task 2 – Project Initiation 

Form my project group.

Register the group and create my project plan in plan.md on GitHub.

Include:

Communication methods and meeting schedule.

Group member names.

Project repository URL.

Task 3 – Network Diagram Design 

Use diagrams.net (draw.io) to create two network layouts:
a) One switch connected to 4 PCs.
b) Two LANs (4 PCs each) connected via three switches in a star topology.

Upload both:

.png image file

.drawio source file

Task 4 – Ping Packet Capture Analysis

Open my previous ping capture (.pcap) file in Wireshark and:

Review packet details and differences.

Draw a labeled network diagram (show IP & MAC addresses).

Explain ARP packets – who sent them and why.

Create packet diagrams for ARP and ICMP packets showing encapsulation and byte sizes.

Describe the first two ICMP packets.

Upload:

Diagrams as .png and .drawio files.

Explanations in your journal.

Task 5 – Optional: ARP Table Monitoring

Use PowerShell to view my computer’s ARP table.

Communicate with other devices (e.g., ping or browse websites).

Note which devices become “Reachable.”
In your journal:

Screenshot of ARP table.

MAC addresses of at least two reachable devices.

Explain which devices they belong to and why.

Summary

Learned how to design and analyze small LANs.

Practiced identifying ARP and ICMP functions.

Explored packet encapsulation and communication between network layers.

Strengthened teamwork and GitHub project management skills.
