Week 10 – Cyber Security Management (Summary)

This week focused on applying cybersecurity management principles using the NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF). Students worked on identifying objectives, managing assets, and analyzing risks within their projects. The goal was to understand how to protect, detect, and respond to cyber threats in an organized and strategic way.

Task 1 – Knowledge Test (10 min)

At the start of the tutorial, students completed a short knowledge test to review their understanding of cybersecurity management concepts, including protection strategies, detection functions, and asset management principles.

Task 2 – Select Security Objectives (20 min)

Students selected four sub-categories of objectives from the NIST Cyber Security Framework, focusing on two from the Protect function and two from the Detect function. Each selected sub-category came from a different category.

For each objective, students explained:

Why it is important to their project, and

Which attack or vulnerability it helps to prevent or reduce.

Example:

Function: Protect → Category: Access Control → Sub-category: Manage identities and access permissions.

Importance: Ensures only authorized users can access sensitive data.

Mitigates: Insider threats and unauthorized access attacks.

This task helped students connect cybersecurity controls to real-world risks and understand how each objective strengthens the system’s defense.

Task 3 – Create Asset Inventory (20 min)

Students revisited the assets they listed in the previous week (Week 9) and expanded the list into a comprehensive asset inventory.
They categorized assets into six types, such as:

Data assets – e.g., customer records, system logs

Hardware assets – e.g., routers, servers, PCs

Software assets – e.g., operating systems, applications

Network assets – e.g., switches, Wi-Fi access points

People assets – e.g., administrators, users

Other supporting assets – e.g., backup drives, cloud storage

Each asset table included:

Identifying details (like IP address, MAC, serial number)

Classification of data based on value or sensitivity

Key protections needed (using the CIA model — Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

This task helped students organize and classify assets, understand their value, and determine the right security controls for each one.

Task 4 – Conduct a Risk Analysis (50 min)

Students used a risk assessment template spreadsheet to perform a risk analysis for their project.
They evaluated:

Potential threats and vulnerabilities

The likelihood and impact of each risk

The overall risk level and possible mitigation measures

Although the completed risk analysis was not added to the journal, it was an important part of the project submission.

This task taught students how to assess risks systematically and make decisions based on risk priorities.

Overall Learning Summary

By the end of Week 10, students learned to:

Apply the NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF) to select relevant objectives for protection and detection

Create a detailed asset inventory that includes classifications and CIA protections

Understand how to analyze and prioritize risks to enhance network security

Connect technical cybersecurity concepts with real-world management practices

This week strengthened students’ skills in strategic cybersecurity planning, asset management, and risk-based decision-making, which are essential for any cybersecurity professional.
