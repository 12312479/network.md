Week 7 – Networking and Cyber Security

Topic: Wireless Networks
Goal: Understand Wi-Fi network configurations, access point management, and teamwork evaluation.

Task 1 – Knowledge Test 

Complete the weekly Knowledge Test in the first 10 minutes.

This checks your understanding before starting practical activities.

Task 2 – View Wi-Fi Details 

Use a Windows laptop or Android phone to explore Wi-Fi details.

On Windows: use PowerShell with WifiTools.

On Android: view Access Point (AP) info or use WiFi Analyzer.
Collect information for 2–3 APs:

SSID

BSSID

Frequency band

Channel

Data rate

In my journal:

List details for at least one Access Point.

Task 3 – Use Wi-Fi Access Point 

Access the web management interface of a Wi-Fi router.

Explore important settings such as SSID, password, encryption type, channel, and bandwidth.

If no real router is available, use TP-Link web emulator.

Compare settings of home vs business Wi-Fi devices if possible.

In your journal:

Identify important settings and explain which you would modify and why.

Include screenshots or photos of the AP settings page.

Task 4 – Self-Evaluation of Teamwork 

Reflect on my project teamwork progress.
In my journal:

Use ChatGPT to find ways to improve teamwork.

Include a screenshot of my AI query and its output.

Compare AI suggestions with your team’s current practices.

Give examples of what my team already does well.

Suggest improvements for the remainder of the project.

Check GitHub → Insights → Contributors to view each member’s commits.

Add a screenshot of the contributions graph.

Reflect on my own contribution:

Compare it with others.

Evaluate team balance and participation.

Suggest steps to improve teamwork and productivity.

Task 5 – Continue Your Project 

Use tutorial time to make further progress on your group project.

Show my current project status to my tutor.

Seek feedback and guidance for improvement.

Summary

Explored Wi-Fi network properties (SSID, BSSID, channels, data rates).

Learned to access and manage wireless router settings securely.

Understood key design choices in Wi-Fi network configuration.

Reflected on teamwork effectiveness and identified improvement strategies.

Continued hands-on project development with tutor feedback.
