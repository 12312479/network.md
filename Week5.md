Week 5 Summary – Networking and Cyber Security

Topic: Network Operations and Analysis
Goal: Deepen understanding of network communication, packet inspection, and system configuration.

Key Learnings:

Learned how network devices communicate using IP addresses and MAC addresses across different layers of the OSI model.

Gained practical experience with Wireshark to observe and analyze real network traffic.

Understood the role of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) in mapping IP addresses to physical MAC addresses.

Analyzed ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) messages to see how devices test connectivity using the ping command.

Practiced packet encapsulation—seeing how data is wrapped in headers and trailers through different layers.

Used diagrams.net (draw.io) to visually represent network topologies and packet structures.

Enhanced skills in problem-solving and documentation, including saving diagrams and explanations in GitHub repositories.

Strengthened team collaboration by maintaining project files, journals, and communication methods.

Overall Reflection:
Week 5 helped reinforce the practical and theoretical aspects of how data travels across a network. You not only built and visualized network diagrams but also learned to interpret real network data using analysis tools, improving both your technical and teamwork abilities.
